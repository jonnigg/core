# Core Utilities

## What is this thing?

Well after writing classes over and over again for the same functionality, I thought it would be wise / nice to have a standard library (if you will) of reusable code. The reusable nature of this code has no limitations. From database to file management, CORE is meant to be your set of tools for any reusuable code you may see fit.
